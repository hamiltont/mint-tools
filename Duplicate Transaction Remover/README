After exporting transactions from Mint.com, this software
will attempt to detect and automatically remove them


Basic usage(currently) is to export apps from Mint, and then to 
place them in some standard directory (right now this is hard
coded to /Users/hamiltont/transactions.csv). 

Run the app, and the CSV of transactions will be imported, duplicates
removed, and the file resaved. Any possible dupes that the software 
is not 100% on will be printed for manual removal later.
